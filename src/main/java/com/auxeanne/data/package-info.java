/**
 * <p>AuxeanneData is a framework to easily store and link POJOs in a database.</p>
 * <p>
 * This project is an experiment to mix the linking efficiency of relational databases and the schemaless flexibility of NoSQL databases.<br>
 * Only the elements from this package are needed to build applications.<br>
 * The test folder is showing reference implementations for most common databases and main usages.<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Important : POJOs must extend the DefaultRecord class to be managed by the framework.
